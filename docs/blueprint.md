# **App Name**: HydroGen

## Core Features:

- Real-time AI Data Analysis visualization: Animated Data Flow Chart: Visually represents transaction data moving from the Input, to Cerebrum, and then parallel to each of the nine AI agents for analysis. Agents return results to Cerebrum for final decision.
- Simulated Agent Communication: Simulated Agent Log Trace: Uses AI to simulate a detailed log trace showing each agent's individual assessment (thinking and output) and Cerebrum's final decision during the fraud analysis.
- Agent Interaction Support: The visualization for Real-time AI Data Analysis supports interaction where hovered
- Secured Payments: The app allows fraud detections, autorouting and re routing failures on payments. All transactions are secure end to end, giving reliability for our stakeholders.
- Enhanced routing: Dynamic Routing. Enable optimal payment routing.
- Enhanced Risk detection: It detects risks like:Fraudulent patterns (via Chimera); Gateway degradation (via Chronos); Identity anomalies (via Persona);Transaction mismatches (via Abacus).
- User transparency on AI outputs: Clear and actionable data displayed with AI outputs so stakeholders have more transparency to business operations and how risks can be improved to save money.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A saturated violet (#A06CD5) to represent advanced intelligence.
- Background color: Dark gray (#121212) for a sleek, modern look.
- Accent color: Cyan (#64B5F6) to highlight interactive elements and key metrics.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for all text, for a futuristic, clean look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Minimalist icons that glow with the accent color, especially related to payment, risk, data processing.
- Flowchart Visualization: Lines clearly connect data sources to each agent, visualizing transaction pathway as a single, elegant design.
- Cards: Cards provide summary overviews when showing long paragraphs to maintain sleek and accessible page.
